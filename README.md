# Simulation of STM32 Based Embedded Systems

## AIM:
To draw the schematic and simulate the embedded system for the given requirement.

## STEPS:

### STEP 1:

We start by designing the circuit in Proteus.

### STEP 2:

3 switches, 1 push button and a pair of LEDs are used for each.

### STEP 3:

The necessary connections are made out to complete the flow from Inputs (switch) to the Outputs (LEDs).

### STEP 4:

Once the entire layout has been designed, we move to coding the Microcontroller.

### STEP 5:
In STM32CubeIDE we configure the necessary pins as GPIO Input and Output pins.

### STEP 6:

Then we use a logical counter to blink the LEDs according to their respective frequencies.

### STEP 7:

After coding all the ports, we build the project and load the .elf file onto the simulator.
